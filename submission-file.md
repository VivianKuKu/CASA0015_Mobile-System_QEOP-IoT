## Introduction to Application


The IoT devices at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park are currently managed by using multiple digital notebooks (e.g. Evernote) to record changes made to the devices and the real-time data is presented at websites differing from project to project, making the on-site operation difficult to work collaboratively.



QEOP IoT helps IoT device managers to check the live MQTT data feed and record the maintenance logs on-site, organising the files and records in one shared platform, especially when maintaining hundreds of devices with several on-site operators.


On the Map page, users can find the location of each device and make sure the device ID they are working with. On the data page, users can check the real-time data feed connecting to the MQTT server, allowing users to see the data status without logging into several web pages for different projects or the MQTT server via computers. 


On the Create page, users can add new logs to record the maintenance, changes, or testing they have made for the specific device. Any detail regarding project ID, device ID, date, time, description, and attachment can be uploaded here. And after the new log is created, users can see the information on the Log page.


The last page, the Profile page, is used to log in and out and is supposed to use to manage the authentication of the app’s functions. For example, team members only can assess to MQTT feed and the log information but can’t create new logs, while only the assigned members can create log information.
